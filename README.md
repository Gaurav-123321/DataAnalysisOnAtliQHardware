May: 23.29M
June: 14.71M (sharp decline)

Insights:
The revenue peaked in February 2020 but saw a gradual decline over the next few months, particularly dropping steeply in June. This could be related to market dynamics such as demand shifts, product availability, or economic conditions (potentially influenced by global events like COVID-19).

Recommendation:
Investigate the reasons for the June decline (e.g., supply chain issues, decreased demand) and devise contingency plans to prevent further drops. Consider introducing new products or promotional strategies during slow months.

Insights:

A large percentage of revenue is concentrated in a few major customers, indicating reliance on these accounts.

Prod065 is the top product by revenue, far ahead of other products.
The lower performance of Prod053 suggests that either demand is low or that it is a niche product.

Recommendation:
Maintain strong relationships with Electricalsara Stores and top customers, possibly offering incentives or exclusive deals to secure long-term contracts. Diversify the customer base to reduce dependence on a single client.
Top 5 Products:

Continue promoting the top products like Prod065, ensuring availability and market visibility. Consider revisiting the strategy for lower-performing products like Prod053, which may require better marketing or discontinuation.
